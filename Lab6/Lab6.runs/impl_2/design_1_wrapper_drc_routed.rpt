PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/keyboard_subordinate_0/U0/keyboard_subordinate_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg_rden is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/keyboard_subordinate_0/U0/keyboard_subordinate_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/IRQ_O_reg_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/keyboard_subordinate_0/U0/keyboard_subordinate_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/IRQ_O_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
